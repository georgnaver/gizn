In the [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10k2pl2/how_to_connect_zotero_with_obsidian/) associated with my [previous post](http://gizn.org/notes/2023/01/20/how-to-connect-zotero-with-obsidian.html) on how to connect Zotero with Obsidian, user TradeTheZones provided an explanation for how to find new variables to import to your template.

>I found that you can use the Data Explorer command in the command palette to see which variables are exposed.
>
>So, you first do Cntrl/Cmd + p, select select zotero integration: data explorer. It will open a tab for you with two buttons, click the "Prompt for Selection", and enter a journal article/ webarticle you have in your zotero library. The tab in Obsidian should then update to show a preview of the import format and which should have all the variables that are exposed.
>
>Note that the variables exposed are going to change based on the type of reference being imported.
