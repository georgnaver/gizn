An outlandish tidbit from the wikipedia article on Rufus Wainwright:

> Wainwright became addicted to [crystal meth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine) in the early 2000s and temporarily lost his vision. His addiction reached its peak in 2002, during what he described as "the most surreal week of my life". During that week, he played a cameo role in the UK comedy television program _[Absolutely Fabulous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolutely_Fabulous)_, spent several nights partying with [George W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Bush)'s daughter [Barbara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Bush_(born_1981)), enjoyed a "debauched evening" with his mother and [Marianne Faithfull](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Faithfull), sang with [Anohni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anohni) of [Antony and the Johnsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antony_and_the_Johnsons) for [Zaldy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaldy)'s spring 2003 collection, and experienced recurring hallucinations of his father throughout. He decided after that he "was either going to rehab or I was going to live with my father. I knew I needed an asshole to yell at me, and I felt he fit the bill."
