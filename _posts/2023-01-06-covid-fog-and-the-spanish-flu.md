In an excellent paper in Cell, [Fernández-Castañeda et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867422007139) aims to explain the lingering neurological symptoms often described in relation to long covid.

> Colloquially known as ‘‘COVID fog,’’ this syndrome of COVID-associated cognitive impairment is characterized by impaired attention, concentration, speed of information processing, memory, and executive function (Becker et al., 2021; Nasserie et al., 2021). Together with increased rates of anxiety, depression, disordered sleep, and fatigue, this syndrome of cognitive impairment contributes substantially to the morbidity of ‘‘long COVID’’

The authors notes that the symptomology of "covid fog" resembles that of "chemo fog.’’

> The syndrome of cognitive symptoms that COVID survivors frequently experience closely resembles the syndrome of cancer-therapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI; Wefel et al., 2015), commonly known as ‘‘chemo fog.’’ Neuroinflammation is central to the pathophysiology of CRCI (for review, see Gibson and Monje, 2021), raising the possibility of shared pathophysiological mechanisms.

In CRCI, elevated levels of neurotoxic cytokines and reactive microglia (brain-resident macrophages) leads to neuroinflammation that impact forms of both gray and white matter plasticity that are important for healthy cognition. 

> Given this context, we hypothesized that the inflammatory response to even mild COVID may induce elevation in neurotoxic cytokines/chemokines, a pattern of white matter microglial reactivity, and consequent dysregulation of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and hippocampal neural precursor cells.

With this as a starting point, the authors went on and studied changes in cytokines and microglial/macrophage reactivity following SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice. They were particularly interested in neurological symptoms following mild covid-19.

> To test the effects of mild COVID, we used a mouse model of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection limited to the respiratory system that clears within 1 week (Israelow et al., 2020; Song et al., 2021).

Notably the authors did not observe signs of severe illness in the studied mice and no virus was detected in the brain. Despite this, levels of many cytokines were prominently elevated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). One cytokine, CCL11, were particularly interesting. CCL11 remained elevated in mouse cerebrospinal fluid 7 weeks post infection and have previously been as associated with cognitive decline in normal aging. They also found increased microglial/macrophage reactivity in subcortical white matter.

Similar patterns were found in human subjects.

> To further explore the relevance of elevated CCL11 levels to cognitive sequelae of COVID infection in humans, we next examined circulating CCL11 cytokine levels in the plasma of people suffering from long COVID with and without cognitive symptoms.

Plasma levels of CCL11 were found to be elevated long covid patients with cognitive symtoms, but not in long covid patients without cognitive symtoms. Further strengthening the correlation between CCL11 and "covid fog".

> Given the prominent elevation of CCL11 in mouse models of mild respiratory COVID and the elevated CCL11 levels in people with cognitive symptoms after COVID, we next tested the effects of systemic CCL11 on microglial reactivity (Figures 5C–5I). Using the systemic CCL11 paradigm described by Villeda and colleagues (Villeda et al., 2011), we administered 4 doses of CCL11 intraperitoneally over a 10-day period (Figure 5C).

Remarkably, systemic administration of CCL11 induced similar patterns in mice brain tissue, suggesting a causal role for CCL11 in COVID fog pathology.

### H1N1

Lasting cognitive impairments following a viral infection is not a new phenomenon. For example the Spanish flu of 1918 (caused by H1N1 influenza virus) was associated with symptoms similar to covid-19 "brain fog".

> We compared the neuroinflammatory response to mild respiratory H1N1 influenza with SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figures 7E–7G). Examination of CSF cytokines at 7 days revealed elevation in several cytokines/chemokines similar to mice with mild respiratory COVID, including IFN-g, CCL11, CCL2, and GMCSF, as well as distinct elevations in IL4 and CCL5 (Figure 7G). By 7 weeks after influenza infection, the only chemokine that remained elevated—and in fact increased from the 7 day time point—is CCL11 (Figures 7E–7G).

The authors note that symptology and brain tissue changes are not fully overlappnig but suggests that CCL11-driven neuroinflammaton may represent a common pathway to cognitive deficits in both mild respiratory COVID-19 and H1N1 influenza as well as maybe other contexts.
