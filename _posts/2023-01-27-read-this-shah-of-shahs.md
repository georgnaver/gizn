[Ryszard Kapuściński](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryszard_Kapuściński), Polish journalist, photographer, poet and author, writer of (among others)  [The Shadow of the Sun,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_of_the_Sun) published 'Shah of Shahs' in 1982, 3 years after the [Iranian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) in 1979. It is his own analysis and recollection of the events that led to the fall of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran, and the revolution that instated the theocratic government that rules Iran today. It is a read worthy book in the light of the on going protests in Iran.

The protests today started with the murder of Mahsa Amini, in custody for allegedly violating Iran's mandatory hijab law. But the book reminds us of that nothing exists in a vacuum:

>Everyone: Attention! The Shah issues an order forbidding Iranian dress. Everyone, wear European suits! Everyone, don European hats! The Shah bans chadors. In the streets, police tear them off terrified women. The faithful protest in the mosques of Meshed. He sends in the artillery to level the mosques and massacre the rebels. (Page 22)

In 1936, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, issued a decree known as [Kashf-e hijab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashf-e_hijab) that banned all Islamic veils, including hijab. Thus, dress has been an integral problem of Iranian politics for a long time.

#### P.S.

Another quote that stuck with me from the book is this description of the eerie atmosphere in Teheran following the revolution:

>The shooting starts regularly at nine as if custom or tradition had fixed the hour. Then the city falls silent. Then there are more shots and muffled explosions. No one’s upset, no one pays attention or feels directly threatened (no one except those who are shot). (Page 12)
